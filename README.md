# SQL--Challenge


## Background

It’s a beautiful spring day, and it’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files. For this challenge, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Methods Used 


An entity relationship diagram (ERD) was used for this challenge.

## Technologies 

The technology used for this challenge include: PostgreSQL, Excel, and VS Code


## Data Source

The data source for this challenge is located in the main repo and the csv files are located in the resources folder.

## Analysis 

For this challenge I had to demonstrate my knowledge of SQL by manipulating the data and returning the results desired. For instance, I created a query to reflect the first name and last name of employees that were hired in 1986. What I noticed was that the data was for the amount of employees hired over a 15 year span, 1986 - 2000. During that time, the number of hires dropped drastically from an intial peak of 36,150 in 1986 to only 13 in 2000, which is a drop of about 99.96%. I determined that the reason for such a drastic drop in hires is due to the fact that the company is probably on the verge of bankruptcy or maybe the company downsized significantly.
